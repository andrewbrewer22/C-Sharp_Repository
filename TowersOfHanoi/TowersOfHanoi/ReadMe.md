# Towers of Hanoi

### What it is

When you open the Towers Of Hanoi program
you will see three rows, or "sticks"
The 1st stick has the numbers 1-4 on it,
the objective is to get all 4 numbers to the 3rd
stick in the same order.

### How to play

The controls are simple. Numbers 1-3 and enter/return
The console will prompt the player with all the required
entry needed. Just do as the console asks and no
problems should arise.

## Good luck and have fun!
